# DownToPlay

DownToPlay is a .NET Core web application used to coordinate gaming interests within a group of people.
Instead of constantly asking everyone if they want to play a game, users can select the games they are interested in joining, letting those who view the page know what others are "down to play".

Users create groups, and other users join to show their interest.
When the minimum number of users join a group, the status changes to show enough users are interested in starting.

This project was created to practice .NET Core MVC, SQL server, and the Web Experience Toolkit.
